### Threats an organisation will face

In an organisation, there are many threats that have to be prevented in order for a company to run smoothly, this can come from a range of sources from hackers with viruses to employees with poor decision making, because of these organisations will have methods to help prevent from the risks of the company. In order to prevent malicous exploits, companies must know almost every tyoe of exploit, internal and external, some of these are:

#### Viruses: 
These are files that can be very dangerous to a computer due to its ability to copy itself and corrupt or destroy data within a computer. It does this by infecting files within the system, when a file is infected it can be corrupted or destroyed entirely, this means that depending from where the viruses originates, it can be extremely dangerous for systems as primary or high priority files can be corrupted or destroyed.  These can be detected with anti malware software, or by having methods to stop access into the data files entirely, this can mean a firewall or a simple auto scanning software, however because it conceals itself within files a full scan is usually required in order to find and remove the folders.

#### Trojan Horse: 
The name comes from the anchient device known as the Trojan horse that was responsible for the fall of troy, it is a form of social engineering where a piece of software is hidden within an email or other form of message and is built to bait people into downloading and/or running a piece of software. The package that the horse can contain can be of any kind, so it could not be malicous at all, however it is most common to find malicous malware such as viruses hidden within the trojan to cause harm to a PC.

#### Rootkit:
Rootkits are quite unique when looking at multiple different malicious software, this is because of how it hides itself from the computer and any security software that is scanning for it. The rootkit looks at manual behaviour of the system, this can be from scanning for different activity within the system annd concealing itself. Because of this the process of removing this process can be a lot different, this can mean that rootkits can be much more dangerous than other software.

#### Worm: 
This is the most common type of malware, its purpose is to clone itself and spread through the network the system is on, this could be the LAN of the system or in a company it could be the it's intranet that it uses. Worms main focus and functions is to cause a disrupt within a system, whether it be the bandwidth that it uses or the speed of the system itself, however some worms are used to attack pieces of security products like firewalls and can cause slow functioning security measures, this itself is very dangerous and can be used to open a securities security protocol. 

#### Internal leaks:
This can otherwise be known as whistleblowers, it is the process of an enployee that holds information that could be vital for a comapny to keep secret to then be exposed and cause the official leak of the information. This can be accidental as there are many ways for a leak to get out, however it is possible for it to be intentional, there can be much to gain by leaking information, because of this there is a lot of risk when handling this information. Most companies will try to solve this issue by having every employee sign a non-discolsure form, this is a form that is used to keep the information of a company to be internal, by signing these forms the employee cannot leak any information from the company that isn't public knowledge, if there was a known leak in the company, the company could sue that person for breaching the form.

#### Social engineering: 
This can lead to any of the malware above to be implemented, however social engineering itself is a form of malware implementation, it involves not trying to break vulnerabilities within a security system or software, but through the physical vulnerabilities, this is primarily done by attempting to use the employees of the company to breach the system, this can be done through a variety of different ways, an example of these can be phishing, this the process of using fake emails or advertisements in order to trick people into downloading certain files or running programs that can be dangerous for the system. Other than this many attempts are made in person by leaving USB's or gaining access into the office. 

Many companies have fallen victim to being socially engineered to cause a breach, this is caused by the unpredictability of the attacks, whilst hacks usually follow a specific pattern, social engineering can be completley random as the method changes depending on the person causing the attacks. The method of entry can sometimes be very simple, for example many employees have been breached by a USB being found and placed within a computer, these USB's can be programed to install files from insertion, this can mean malware can be injected directly into the system from an internal system, this can mean that a lot of damage can occur from this.

## Procedures in security

When looking at different types of companies, they all operate in unique ways that allow the their employees to operate within a set procedures, these will be in place in order to allow the company to remain in a set motion, this is also to allow better security within a company, for example one procedure that a company may always need is to have a form of ID when coming into the building, this means that only people that are allowed access within the building can get in. This procedure allows the company to choose who they want to enter the company and has a way of protecting it from unwanted individuals. 

In reboot games, the procedures for security are similar and provide an added layer of protection for the company, some of the procedures that reboot games use are:

#### ID pass:
In the college that reboot games resides in, there are gates that an individual must get through in order to have access into the college, for this you must either be on the system or have an ID card that can grant access through the gates, the ID pass can be retrieved from the college itself and puts your identity onto the college system. In order to bypass this procedure, the individual would need to obtain one of these ID cards and identity theft. The procedure in steps would look like:

Enter college --- Approach Gate --- Hold correct ID card in hand --- Place card over required area --- Wait for light to turn green --- wait for gates to open --- Walk through gate opening --- Wait for gate to close behind.

The steps for this procedure are very basic and despite this they are important when taking safety into consideration, this is because the simple method of ID cards can be very effective at stopping unwanted individuals or groups from coming into the college without being caught.

#### Door Lock:
Not only is an ID card required to get into the college, but also some of them can be used to unlock certain areas within the college, many doors in the college cannot be opened without a valid pass, this means only people that need to use the room and can use it responsibly will be able to enter them. People with ID passes that can come into the college may not be able to access these rooms, this is to make sure that only more trusted individuals can have access to the room. In order to gain access the ID card that you have must be authorized to access these areas, the procedure in order to access the door is:

Enter college --- pass gate with normal measures --- Identify door that you want to access --- Ensure you have authroization to access the room --- Place ID card on required area --- Wait for red light to turn green --- Proceed to push or pull the door to open.

The steps are in place in order to make sure that anyone that would make it into the college would also then have another step in order to make it into more important areas, this increases the security of the area as it is another step for any attacker to bypass.

#### Access Code: 
This is where instead of using a form of ID when having a security procedure, many companies will use a keypad in order to gain access to the building, this can be safer than ID as it cannot be stolen in a physical sense, this is because the code can be remembered from memory as it is only a string of digits and does not rely on a scan of any kind in order to gain access. Instead this can be easier to steal by simply observing, this can be more beneficial or can disrupt a company depending on the attacker as it can be easier or harder.

Enter building --- Make way to code pad --- Make sure to retrieve code and remember --- Enter correct code into code pad --- Wait for code pad to accept code and unlock door --- Open door of pull or push --- Enter doorway

#### Regular pat-downs:
It is a security procedure that occurs occasionally and it is a pat-down, this is done by having metal detectors, in front of the gates, this allows staff to search students, this can help keep the college and reboot games safe as it can stop any dangerous items from entering the college and therefore reboot games. This search is done by the police and can be very beneficial for the college as having dangerous items within the college can cause many issues with people.

Enter college --- Wait in line --- Move forward in queue until reach metal detectors --- Listen to police's instructions --- Walk through the metal detector --- Be patted down --- Retrieve items --- Continue on through the day

The procedure is possible to be changed within the different stages with the event of items being found or bigger or smaller queue.
