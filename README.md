### Threats an organisation will face

In an organisation, there are many threats that have to be prevented in order for a company to run smoothly, this can come from a range of sources from hackers with viruses to employees with poor decision making, because of these organisations will have methods to help prevent from the risks of the company. In order to prevent malicous exploits, companies must know almost every tyoe of exploit, internal and external, some of these are:

Viruses: These are files that can be very dangerous to a computer due to its ability to copy itself and corrupt or destroy data within a computer. These can be detected with anti malware software, or by having methods to stop access into the data files entirely.

Trojan Horse: The name comes from the anchient device known as the Trojan horse that was responsible for the fall of troy, it is a form of social engineering where a piece of software is hidden within an email or other form of message and is built to bait people into downloading and/or running a piece of software. The package that the horse can contain can be of any kind, so it could not be malicous at all, however it is most common to find malicous malware such as viruses hidden within the trojan to cause harm to a PC.

Rootkit: Rootkits are quite unique when looking at multiple different malicious software, this is because of how it hides itself from the computer and any security software that is scanning for it. The rootkit looks at manual behaviour of the system, this can be from scanning for different activity within the system annd concealing itself. Because of this the process of removing this process can be a lot different, this can mean that rootkits can be much more dangerous than other software.

Worm: This is the most common type of malware,
